I am implementing the efficient Convolutional Neural Network MobileNetV2 and Support Vector Machine with the main objective to classify the maligant skin cancer melanoma from non-melanoma lesions. 
The objective is to maximize recall (minimizing the false negatives as the positive class is melanoma). The dataset used is the ISIC-2019 Challenge dataset with 25331 total images.
